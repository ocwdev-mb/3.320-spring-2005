Objective
---------

The class is aimed at beginning graduate students and will introduce a variety of methods used in different fields of materials science.

Organization
------------

Two 90 minute lectures with some lectures replaced by a laboratory.

Five lab assignments approximately every two or three weeks.

Grading
-------

Grading is based on the lab assignments. There are no exams.

Textbooks
---------

There is no required book for the course. Following are some suggested reference works; additional references are provided in lecture.
