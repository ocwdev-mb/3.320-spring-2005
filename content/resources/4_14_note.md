description: This file is an annotated version of class notes "Free Energies and Physical
  Coarse-Graining" and explains non-boltzmann and umbrella sampling, non-metropolis
  Monte Carlo, example of force-bias Monte Carlo, methods to obtain free energy differences,
  overlapping distribution methods, thermodynamic integration, and methods with multiple
  time scales.
