description: This file is an annotated version of class notes "Excitations in Materials
  and How to Sample Them" and explains temperature (formal; classical picture), changes
  in materials with temperature, bulk modulus change with T, calculation of thermal
  expansion, modeling of finite temperature systems, and statistical mechanics on
  relevant degrees of freedom with examples.
